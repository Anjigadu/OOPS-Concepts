# What is method overloading?

Solution: <br><br>
Having multiple copies of a method, with the same name but different signatures is called method overloading. <br>
Method overloading cannot be accomplished by only changing the return type, as it causes ambiguity in the system. <br><br>
Overloading is determined at the compile time. It occurs when several methods have same names with:<br>
-> Different method signature and different number or type of parameters.<br>
-> Same method signature but different number of parameters.<br>
-> Same method signature and same number of parameters but of different type.
