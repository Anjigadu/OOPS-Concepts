# What is method overriding?

Solution: <br><br>
Overriding occurs when a class method has the same name and signature as a method in parent class. <br>
When you override methods, JVM determines the proper methods to call at the programâ€™s run time, not at the compile time.
<br> Static methods cannot be overriden, because static methods have class scope and not instance(Object) scope.
